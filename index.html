        <p>As overlay networking becomes more pervasive in the data center, the need for a solid underlay is mandatory. It's common practice to build an underlay based off a 3-stage or 5-stage Clos IP fabric, but current designs have an operational burden and are static in nature. Building a large Clos IP fabric that's able to be programmatically managed and provisioned reduces the operational burden. Additional underlay services such as quality of service, rate-limiting, and traffic separation further increases the value of the underlay network. By using existing protocols and networking concepts, it's possible to create a programmable Clos IP fabric that offers underlay services. Service Providers can use the new underlay services and traffic separation to create a new service - Overlay as a Service - geared towards customers who want to build and manage their own overlay network. Enterprises can leverage the additional underlay services to strictly enforce SLAs and provide additional security that's mutually exclusive from the overlay.</p>
