OpenClos - create and maintain large Clos networks
==================================================

As overlay networking becomes more pervasive in the data center, the need for a solid underlay is mandatory. It's common practice to build an underlay based off a 3-stage or 5-stage Clos IP fabric, but current designs have an operational burden and require that the creation and mainteance of the Clos IP fabric be performed programmatically.

Companies who wish to implement a large Clos network must write customized software to manage it; we've seen numberous presentations and stories of such companies and tools. Unfortunately these are internal tools and not available to the public.

OpenClos is going to change the way we think about large Clos networks; it's an open-source project that includes all of the tools necessary to create and maintain large Clos networks.
